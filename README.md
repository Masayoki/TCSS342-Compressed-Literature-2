# TCSS342-Compressed-Literature-2
Worked on a project that took in large collections of raw text files like Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace consisting of over 3 million characters and about 22000 different 
words and compressing it using Huffman’s encoding and hash tables to help store the word counts.
